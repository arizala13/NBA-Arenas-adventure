NBA Stadiums adventure 

This is a text based game that was created in C. It uses unix to create a file with NBA stadiums that are connected then uses the adventure file to get the most recent created stadiums. The stadiums are connected and there is only one start room and one end room. Once the end room is visited the user is told the game is over and the rooms visited and number of steps taken is displayed. 


To run this copy buildrooms.c in terminal, then copy adventure.c in terminal. 

After to make them executable type in gcc -o arizalan.buildrooms.c arizalan.buildrooms and gcc -o arizalan.adventure.c arizalan.adventure

If using macOS you will use clang instead of gcc. 

Then you can use ./arizalan.buildrooms to create rooms. Then ./arizalan.adventure will get the most recently created buildrooms instance to play the game. 

Lastly, enjoy! I plan on adding all 30 nba teams and more.
